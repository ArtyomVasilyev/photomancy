## Frequently Asked Questions

### Getting Started

**How does Photomancy work?**
Each day, Photomancy randomly selects a photo from your library and transforms it into a personalized card with unique mystical artwork, an interpretation, and a song recommendation.

**Why does the app need photo access?**
Photomancy needs access to your photos to create personalized experiences from your memories. We only access one random photo at a time and never browse or store your photo library.

### Daily Reveals

**How often can I get a new reveal?**
- **Basic subscribers:** 1 card per day (24-hour cooldown)
- **Premium subscribers:** 2 cards per day (12-hour cooldown)

**When does my daily card reset?**
Your cooldown timer starts after each card generation. Check the timer in the app header to see when your next reveal is available.

**Can I choose which photo to use?**
No, the app randomly selects a photo from your library. This randomness is part of the surprise experience.

All your cards are stored locally on your device, not on our servers.
